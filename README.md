Our awesome TFM

## Installation

### Docker image preparations

TBD

### Helm dependencies

The application chart has dependendecies in external Chart files for Kafka and Zookeeper services. It is needed, prior the application deployment, to update the helm dependencies in order to download the charts for these services.

First it is needed to install the Helm Incubator repository:

```bash
$ helm repo add incubator https://kubernetes-charts-incubator.storage.googleapis.com/
"incubator" has been added to your repositories
```

And update the dependencies:

```bash
$ cd $GIT_REPO/charts
$ helm dependency update tfm-almacar
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Unable to get an update from the "local" chart repository (http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts):
